Williamstown Lake, located in Grant County, Kentucky, is a 365-acre public reservoir created in 1955 by impounding the South Fork of Grassy Creek. Officially opened for recreation in 1957, the lake serves as a primary water source for the city of Williamstown and surrounding communities. With over 20 miles of tree-lined shoreline, it has become a popular destination for boating, fishing, and paddling. The lake supports a variety of fish species, including largemouth bass, crappie, bluegill, and channel catfish. Annual events like "Paddle Williamstown" and the Labor Day Boat Parade attract visitors, while local marinas offer amenities such as boat rentals and dining options. The map has a detailed surface elevation model showing all the cracks, crevasses, rivers, and vegetation on the map. Despite these issues, Williamstown Lake remains a cherished recreational spot in northern Kentucky.â€‹
